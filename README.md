Eatery - The Online Shopping Portal
This is an online shopping portal project built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It allows users to register, login, view and edit their profile, browse through inventory, add items to cart, place orders, view order history, and checkout.

Key Features:
User Authentication: Users can register and login securely. Passwords are hashed before storing in the database.
Profile Management: Users can view their profile details.
Inventory Management: The inventory page displays a list of available items with search functionality to find items by name.
Shopping Cart: Users can add items to the shopping cart, view the cart, and proceed to checkout.
Order History: Users can view their order history, including details of each order such as order ID, items, total amount, date, and status.
Checkout Process: Users can proceed to checkout from the shopping cart, enter shipping details, and place orders.

Design and Implementation
The project is designed using the MERN stack to provide a full-stack web application. The backend server is built using Node.js and Express.js, providing RESTful APIs for authentication, user management, and order processing. MongoDB is used as the database to store user information, inventory items, and orders.

The frontend is built using React.js, providing a responsive and interactive user interface. The application uses React Router for client-side routing and Axios for making HTTP requests to the backend APIs.
